# GameOfLife

*Python implementation of Convays Game of Life*

    - Python
    - PyQt
    - NumPy
    - Scipy

**Game grid is randomly sat at start in matrix 500x500 cells with cell size 5x5.
Optimization made with using numpy arrays and method convolve from scipy package to process cells life logic
and creating separate thread for it, so the programm can work on logic and drawing concurently.**
